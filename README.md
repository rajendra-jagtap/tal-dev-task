Q1) Use any infrastructure as code(Terraform, Cloudformation, Pulumi) tool to design the following architecture in AWS. Consider DB server as a normal instance in the private subnet. Put your scripts in your GitHub repo and share the repo link as the answer 

Q2) There is a python project publicly available: 

https://github.com/macloo/basic-flask-app 

Now fork this repo to your account and write a Dockerfile to run this python application in the Docker container at 5000 port. Commit your code to the repo and share us the GitHub link in the response area 

Q3) Use Ansible/chef/puppet/bash script to build the Docker image of the python application you created in section 2 and deploy this docker image in the webserver created by you in section 1. After deployment, the application should be reachable at <webserver-public-ip>:5000 port
